							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<br>
							<p>
								I first played around with code at the age of 10 while playing video games. Since then, I've been looking for new ways to make my life more efficient through technology. Now, I want to do the same for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
							<p>
								My name is Joey. Outside of work, I love traveling, trying new recipes and restaurants, or catching up with friends over a nice glass of wine. I am always looking for new recommendations!
